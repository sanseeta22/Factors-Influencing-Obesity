# Problem to solve

Obesity is a significant public health challenge affecting individuals worldwide. Researchers till date, have tried numerous ways to determine the factors that cause obesity.​

Mexico, Peru and Colombia are facing the same health challenge. In these countries, overweight and obesity are a major risk for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke) and the leading cause of death in the region from diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease.​

My objective is to identify the important factors that contribute to obesity in these countries based on their eating habits and physical condition.

# Method

# Data collection:
This step involves gathering data from Kaggel, in my case I had one CSV file

# Data cleaning and transformation:
This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.

# Data visualization:
This step involves creating various graphs, charts, and other visualizations to understand the data's distribution and identify patterns and trends.

# Data analysis: 
This step involves performing statistical analyses on the data to uncover any relationships between the variables.

# Data interpretation: 
This step involves drawing conclusions from the data analysis.

# Key findings:

I found a model that had really good accuracy:
Logistic Regression : 92% prediction accuracy 

Compared with another model that is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
got the accuracy of 79 %.

Overall, the logistic regression model in comparison to KNN model seems to be the preferred choice for this classification task based on the evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion:

Our analysis highlights the importance of both numerical and categorical factors in understanding and predicting obesity types. Weight, age, and several categorical variables such as family history with overweight and gender emerged as significant predictors of obesity types. The logistic regression model yielded high accuracy and precision, indicating its effectiveness in predicting obesity types based on the identified features.

# Recommendations & next steps:

Want to get more data,like area,occupation,diseases,year
